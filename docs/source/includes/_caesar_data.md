# Caesar Data Model

## External API calls
When an ExternalExtractor or ExternalReducer the classification data is sent to the given URL (requires HTTPS) as JSON data. The external API then does the processing and returns a response to Caeser. The response from the external endpoint must be:

+ 200 (OK) 
+ 201 (Resource Created)
+ 202 (Processing Started)
+ 204 (No Data)

All other responses will result in an error on Caesar. The data format for the sent/received data differ based on whether the endpoint is an extractor or a reducers. Details are given below:

The ExternalExtractor gets the raw data from the classification. There are a set of standard fields that are common across all task types, but individual tasks contain specific data formats tailored to the data that they send. The common fields are:

+ `id` : The unique ID for the classification
+ `project_id` : The ID for the project that this classification belongs to
+ `workflow_id` : The workflow attached to the classification
+ `workflow_version` : The version for the workflow (*is this something that project builders can set?*)
+ `subject_id` : The ID for the subject that was classified
+ `user_id` : The unique ID for the user who classified this subject
+ `annotations` : Dictionary containing the actual classification data (differs based on the number of tasks, and the task types)
+ `metadata` : Additional data for this classification. Most are standard HTTP headers, except
	+ `started_at`, `finished_at` : The start and times for this classification
	+ `live_project` : whether the project is live
	+ `interventions` : data on whether the volunteer was shown any feedback messages
	+ `subject_dimensions` : The size of the subject (in pixels) on the screen
	+ `subject_selection_state` : Data about the subject's retirement state and whether it has been seen before. 
+ `subject` : Data about the subject, including
	+ `id` : The unique subject ID in the database
	+ `metadata` : Additional data about the subject (including filename, and whether it is a `gold_standard` data)
