## External API calls
When an ExternalExtractor or ExternalReducer is called the classification data is sent to the given URL (requires HTTPS) as JSON data. The external API then does the processing and returns a response to Caeser. The response from the external endpoint must be:

+ 200 (OK) 
+ 201 (Resource Created)
+ 202 (Processing Started)
+ 204 (No Data)

All other responses will result in an error on Caesar. The data format for the classification data sent to an external extractor is shown below below:

The extractors gets the raw data from the classification. There are a set of standard fields that are common across all task types, but individual tasks contain specific data formats tailored to the data that they send. The common fields are:

+ `id` : The unique ID for the classification
+ `project_id` : The ID for the project that this classification belongs to
+ `workflow_id` : The workflow attached to the classification
+ `workflow_version` : The version for the workflow (*is this something that project builders can set?*)
+ `subject_id` : The ID for the subject that was classified
+ `user_id` : The unique ID for the user who classified this subject
+ `annotations` : Dictionary containing the actual classification data (differs based on the number of tasks, and the task types)
+ `metadata` : Additional data for this classification. Most are standard HTTP headers, except
	+ `started_at`, `finished_at` : The start and times for this classification
	+ `live_project` : whether the project is live
	+ `interventions` : data on whether the volunteer was shown any feedback messages
	+ `subject_dimensions` : The size of the subject (in pixels) on the screen
	+ `subject_selection_state` : Data about the subject's retirement state and whether it has been seen before. 
+ `subject` : Data about the subject, including
	+ `id` : The unique subject ID in the database
	+ `metadata` : Additional data about the subject (including filename, and whether it is a `gold_standard` data)


## Task specific data

> Example of annotation data

```json
  "annotations": {
    "T0": [
      {
        "task": "T0",
        "value": 0
      }
    ],
    "T1": [
      {
        "task": "T1",
        "value": [
          {
            "x": 315.75,
            "y": 151.96665954589844,
            "toolIndex": 3,
            "tool": 3,
            "frame": 0,
            "details": []
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "T2": [
      {
        "task": "T2",
        "value": "ffdddsssaaa"
      }
    ]
  }
```

The data for each task is passed into the `annotations` key in the JSON dictionary. The tasks are listed by the task name, with each entry containing information related to the type of task. The name of the task is stored in the `task` key, while the data associated with the task is stored in the `value` key. The `value` can vary from a simple text/number to a dictionary depending on the task type. In the example on the right, the first task is a question, the second is a point tool, and the third is a text tool.
