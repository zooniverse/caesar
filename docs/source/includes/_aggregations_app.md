A list of task-specific outputs is detailed in the sections below. 

## Tool specific data

### Question tool

>Sample task data for a simple Question task

```json
"T0": [
  {
	"task": "T0",
	"value": 0,
	"taskType": "single"
  }
```

The question tool stores the answer in the`value` key, as the index of the answer (first answer is a 0).
## Data Formats for Extractors
In this section, we outline the JSON data format details to be passed to different extractors in the aggregation-caeser API. If you have a custom ExternalExtractor API, you must make sure that the input and output data is in the same format as shown here. 

>Sample task data for a simple Question extractor

```json
"T0": [
  {
	"task": "T0",
	"value": 0,
	"taskType": "single"
  }
```

### Question Extractor 


The question extract retrieves the `value` key from a task. For a normal
question task, the value is the index of the answer (first answer is a
0), and how many times that answer has been chosen. 

> returns

```json
{
    "0": 1,
    "aggregation_version": "3.6.0"
}
```




## Shape Extractor
This is a general-purpose extractor that can retrieve information regarding various shape tools used. One can specify which shape information to extract by passing the `task identifier` (e.g., `T0`) and `shape=name` (e.g., `shape=rectangle`) as such: `https://aggregation-caesar.zooniverse.org/extractors/shape_extractor?task=T1&shape=circle`. The following are the list of shapes that you can extract using the shape extractor:

+ `Rectangle Extractor`
+ `Circle Extractor`
+ `Point Extractor`
+ `Line Extractor`


> Example data for a Rectangle Extractor

```json
 "T1": [
      {
        "task": "T1",
        "value": [
          {
            "x": 190.0546875,
            "y": 292.55859375,
            "tool": 1,
            "angle": -36.34308118417328,
            "frame": 0,
            "width": 313.40234375,
            "height": 149.66796875,
            "details": []
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
```


### Rectangle Extractor

A rectangle extractor takes the following information from the data dump (in the specified format on the right) to extract details of the rectangles specified by the classifier. The usage is `https://aggregation-caesar.zooniverse.org/extractors/shape_extractor?task=T1&shape=rectangle`

__Note__: There is a dedicated `Rectangle Extractor` that one can use instead of the shape extractor by `https://aggregation-caesar.zooniverse.org/extractors/rectangle_extractor?task=T1`, where `task=T*` should be the task identifier corresponding to the rectangle tool usage task.

#### Input
+ `x`: x coodrinate of the rectangle's centroid.
+ `y`: y coordinate of the rectangle's centroid.
+ `tool`: tool id of the rectangle?
+ `angle`: rotation angle of the rectangle.
+ `frame`: ???
+ `width`: width of the rectangle.
+ `height`: height of the rectangle.

>Example output of the rectangle extractor

```json
{
    "aggregation_version": "3.6.0",
    "frame0": {
        "T1_tool1_height": [
            149.66796875
        ],
        "T1_tool1_width": [
            313.40234375
        ],
        "T1_tool1_x": [
            190.0546875
        ],
        "T1_tool1_y": [
            292.55859375
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Output
The parameters follow the general format of TaskIdentifier_ToolIdentifier 

+ `frameX`: ??
+ `T*_tool*_height`: The width of the .
+ `T*_tool*_width`: The height of the tool ()









>Sample task data for a Circle Extractor

```json
"T1": [
      {
        "task": "T1",
        "value": [
          {
            "r": 82.84781455160156,
            "x": 276.80859375,
            "y": 317.0390625,
            "tool": 0,
            "angle": 159.37755608105448,
            "frame": 0,
            "details": []
          }
        ]
]
```

### Circle Extractor
You can use the `shape=circle` argument to specify the shape extractor to get the information of the circle tool used in the classification task. Example usage is: `https://aggregation-caesar.zooniverse.org/extractors/shape_extractor?task=T1&shape=circle`, where `task=T*` is the task corresponding to the circle tool.

+ `task`: task identifier
+ `r`: Radius of the circle.
+ `x`: x coordinate of the circle's center.
+ `y`: y coordinate of the circle's center.
+ `tool`: ??
+ `angle`: azimuthal rotation angle??




> Sample data for the tasks empty extractor
> Multiple tasks where each task is empty:

```json
    "T0": [
      {
        "task": "T0"
      }
    ],
    "T1": [
      {
        "task": "T1"
      }
    ]
```

> Sample data for point extractor

```json
"T1": [
  {
	"task": "T1",
	"value": [
	  {
		"x": 278.75,
		"y": 141.96665954589844,
		"tool": 3,
		"frame": 0,
		"details": []
	  }
	]
  }
]

```

### Point extractor/Point extractor by frame
This extractor obtains the x, y coordinate values of the point task. Note that in this case,
the external URL must also contain the task ID (e.g., [https://aggregation-caesar.zooniverse.org/extractors/point_extractor?task=T1](https://aggregation-caesar.zooniverse.org/extractors/point_extractor?task=T1)) so that the extractor has information about the task from which to extract the coordinate values. In this case, the following values are used as input in the `value` key:

+ `x` : The x-coordinate of the point
+ `y` : The y-coordinate of the point
+ `tool`: (I think this is the index of the tool on the front end?)
+ `frame` : .... no clue
+ `details` : .... no clue

The returned values are in the format `[taskID]_tool[toolID]_[x/y]`, similar to the other shape extractors above. 

The `point_extractor_by_frame` extractor performs a similar function, except at the output level, where each (x,y) coordinate value is categorized by the frame number:

> returns

```json
{
    "T1_tool3_x": [
        278.75
    ],
    "T1_tool3_y": [
        141.96665954589844
    ],
    "aggregation_version": "3.6.0"
}
```

> or with the `point_extractor_by_frame`:

```json
{
    "aggregation_version": "3.6.0",
    "frame0": {
        "T1_tool3_x": [
            278.75
        ],
        "T1_tool3_y": [
        	141.96665954589844
        ]
    }
}
```

### Line Extractor 
A line extraction functionality in the shape extractor retrieves the information of the `(x1,y1)` and `(x2,y2)` points of the line. Example usage is: `https://aggregation-caesar.zooniverse.org/extractors/shape_extractor?task=T1&shape=line`, where `task=T*` is the task corresponding to the line tool.

> Sample input data to line extractor

```json
{
          {
            "x1": 191.75,
            "x2": 647.75,
            "y1": 477.9666748046875,
            "y2": 295.9666748046875,
            "tool": 2,
            "frame": 0,
            "details": []
          }
}
```

> Output of the line extraction

```json
{
    "aggregation_version": "3.6.0",
    "frame0": {
        "T1_tool2_x1": [
            191.75
        ],
        "T1_tool2_x2": [
            647.75
        ],
        "T1_tool2_y1": [
            477.9666748046875
        ],
        "T1_tool2_y2": [
            295.9666748046875
        ]
    }
}
```

### All Tasks Empty extractor

This extractor checks whether all tasks in the classification are empty. 
If all tasks do not have a `value` key, then the extractor returns the 
`result` key as `True`. If any of the tasks have a classification, then 
the `result` key is `False`. 

> returns

```json
{
    "aggregation_version": "3.6.0",
    "result": true
}
```
