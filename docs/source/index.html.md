# Introduction

Caesar is an evolution of the Nero codebase, which is made more generic. In
essence, Caesar receives classifications from the event stream (a Lambda script
sends them to Caesars HTTP API).

For each classification, it runs zero or more extractors defined in the
workflow to generate "extracts". These extracts specify information summarized
out of the full classification.

Whenever extracts change, Caesar will then run zero or more reducers defined in
the workflow. Each reducer receives all the extracts, merged into one hash per
classification. The task of the reducer is to aggregate results from multiple
classifications into key-value pairs, where values are simple data types:
integers or booleans. The output of each reducer is stored in the database as a
`Reduction`.

Whenever a reduction changes, Caesar will then run zero or more [rules defined
in the
workflow](https://github.com/zooniverse/caesar/blob/master/docs/rules.md). Each
rule is a boolean statement that can look at values produced by reducers (by
key), compare. Rules support logic clauses like `and` / `or` / `not`. When the
rule evaluates to `true`, all of the effects associated with that rule will be
performed. For instance, an effect might be to retire a subject.

```

To make this more concrete, an example would be a survey-task workflow where:

* An extractor emits key-value pairs like `lion=1` when the user tagged a lion
  in the image.
* A reducer combines multiple classifications by adding up the lion counts,
  emitting `lion=5, coyote=1`
* A rule then checks `lion > 4`, which returns true, and therefore Caesar
  retires the image.

Reducers can reduce across multiple subjects' extracts if the following is
included in the new subject's metadata (when uploaded to Panoptes): `{
previous_subject_ids: [1234] }`. Extracts whose subject ids match an id in that
array will be included in reductions for the new subject.

# Usage

Caesar listens to classification events for workflows from the event stream.
You need to let Caesar know to listen to this workflow and it has to be a
workflow you have access to in zooniverse.org.

There are two ways to configure Caesar, manually via the UI or programmatically the API.
E.g. with a Zooniverse.org workflow id = 1234

## Configuring Caesar via the Web UI
 + Visit https://caesar.zooniverse.org/ and login.
 + Then navigate to https://caesar.zooniverse.org/workflows/new?id=1234 and click enable
 + Use the UI to configure your rules and effects as per the [rules](#rules) & [effects](#effects) docs.

## Configuring Caesar via the API
1. Create a workflow
    + POST JSON request to `https://caesar.zooniverse.org/workflows/?id=1234`
0. Update the workflow with a configuration object payload (see [rules](docs/rules.md#rules) & [effects](docs/effects.md))
    + PUT JSON request to `/workflows/1234` with payload
```
{
  "extractors_config": { },
  "reducers_config": { }
  "rules_config": [
    {
      "if": ["gte", ["lookup", "survey-total-VHCL"], ["const", 1]],
      "then": [{"action": "retire_subject"}]
     }
  ]
}
```

# Authentication

> To authenticate, use an OAuth bearer token obtained from Panoptes:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: Bearer xyz"
```

Caesar uses the same OAuth bearer token as Panoptes to allow access to the API. By default any data relating to a workflow is only accessible to project owners and collaborators.

Caesar expects for the bearer token to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Bearer xyz`

You must replace <code>xyz</code> with your personal API key.
