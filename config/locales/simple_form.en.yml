This lets you specify a minimum version, classifications made on older workflow versions will be ignored. Workflow version numbers look like 4.69 where the first number increments with task changes, and the minor number after the decimal increments with textual changes. Leaving it blank will make this work on all versions.'

When using negative numbers, keep in mind that the meaning of 'the last classification' changes when another classification is made."
